<p>
  <strong><u>Systematic reviews</u></strong> are a type of evidence synthesis    which formulate research questions that are broad or narrow in scope, and identify and synthesize data that directly relate to the systematic review question.<br> While some people might associate 'systematic review' with 'meta-analysis', there are multiple kinds of review which can be defined as 'systematic' which do not involve a meta-analysis. Some systematic reviews critically appraise research studies, and synthesize findings qualitatively or quantitatively.<br> Systematic reviews are often designed to provide an exhaustive summary of current evidence relevant to a research question. For example, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials are an important way of informing evidence-based medicine, and a review of existing studies is often quicker and cheaper than embarking on a new study.
