  <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" title="AI meaning">AI</a></h2>
  <p><strong><u>Artificial intelligence (AI)</u></strong> is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.</p>
  <p><img src="app.jpg"></p>
  <p>The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen.<br> 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence).<br> Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.<br> Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>
